Composition is a `has-a` relationship between objects. But the part is not independent compared to [[20251228102815-aggregation|aggregation]]. It's a stronger `whole-part` relationship, and it's meaningless if the whole doesn't exist. 

> [!info] Favor composition over inheritance.

From Effective Java 3rd [^1]

Here's a Java demo.

```java
public class Whole {
	private final Part part;
	
	// Create it internally.
	public Whole() {
		this.part = new Part();
	}
	
	// 
	public String getPartData() {
		return this.part.getData();
	}
	
	// No setter
}

public class Part {
	private String data = "I'm part.";
}
```
