Aggregation is a `has-a` relationship between objects. It's a `whole-part` relationship. Parts can exist even if the whole has been destroyed. Parts can be independent **compared** to a [[20251228103618-composition|composition]].

The member can be injected by the **constructor** or **setter** method. 

Here's a Java demo.

```java
public class Whole {
	private final Part part;
	private final List<Part> parts;
	
	public Whole(Part part, List<Part> parts) {
		this.part = part;
		this.parts = parts;
	}
	
	public void assembleWhoe(Part part) {
		this.part = part;
	}
}

public class Part {

}
```
