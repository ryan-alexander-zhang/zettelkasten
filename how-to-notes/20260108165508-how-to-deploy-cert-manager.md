⚠️  WARNING: New default private key rotation policy for Certificate resources.The default private key rotation policy for Certificate resources was  
changed to `Always` in cert-manager >= v1.18.0.  
Learn more in the [1.18 release notes](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/release-notes/release-notes-1.18).  
  
cert-manager v1.19.2 has been deployed successfully!  
  
In order to begin issuing certificates, you will need to set up a ClusterIssuer  
or Issuer resource (for example, by creating a 'letsencrypt-staging' issuer).  
  
More information on the different types of issuers and how to configure them  
can be found in our documentation:  
  
https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/  
  
For information on how to configure cert-manager to automatically provision  
Certificates for Ingress resources, take a look at the `ingress-shim`  
documentation:  
  
https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/  
```

Try to configure Let's Encrypt to configure the TLS. Refer to [[20260109103600-how-to-use-cert-manager]]
