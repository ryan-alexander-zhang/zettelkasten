## Using rustup[^1] to install rust

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

```sh

Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, you need to source
the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
source $"($nu.home-path)/.cargo/env.nu"  # For nushell
```

## Verify the installation

```sh
rustc -V
cargo -V
```
