## ADK Agent Demo

### Install Google ADK

```shell
pip install google-adk
```

### Configure the Google AI Studio API Key

```python
import os
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient

try:
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
    os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY
    print("✅ Gemini API key setup complete.")
except Exception as e:
    print(
        f"🔑 Authentication Error: Please make sure you have added 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' to your Kaggle secrets. Details: {e}"
    )
```

### Import Dependencies

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
from google.adk.tools import google_search
from google.genai import types

print("✅ ADK components imported successfully.")
```

### Configure Retry Policy

```python
retry_config=types.HttpRetryOptions(
    attempts=5,  # Maximum retry attempts
    exp_base=7,  # Delay multiplier
    initial_delay=1, # Initial delay before first retry (in seconds)
    http_status_codes=[429, 500, 503, 504] # Retry on these HTTP errors
)
```

### Define Agent

```python
root_agent = Agent(
    name="helpful_assistant",
    model=Gemini(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
        retry_options=retry_config
    ),
    description="A simple agent that can answer general questions.",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Use Google Search for current info or if unsure.",
    tools=[google_search],
)

print("✅ Root Agent defined.")
```

### Run Agent

```python
runner = InMemoryRunner(agent=root_agent)

print("✅ Runner created.")

response = await runner.run_debug(
    "What is Agent Development Kit from Google? What languages is the SDK available in?"
)
```

### ADK Web Interface

```python
!adk create sample-agent --model gemini-2.5-flash-lite --api_key $GOOGLE_API_KEY
url_prefix = get_adk_proxy_url()
```

## ADK Multi Agent Demo

### First Multi-agent Demo

```python
import os
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient

try:
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
    os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY
    print("✅ Gemini API key setup complete.")
except Exception as e:
    print(
        f"🔑 Authentication Error: Please make sure you have added 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' to your Kaggle secrets. Details: {e}"
    )

from google.adk.agents import Agent, SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
from google.adk.tools import AgentTool, FunctionTool, google_search
from google.genai import types

print("✅ ADK components imported successfully.")

# configure retry policy
retry_config=types.HttpRetryOptions(
    attempts=5,  # Maximum retry attempts
    exp_base=7,  # Delay multiplier
    initial_delay=1,
    http_status_codes=[429, 500, 503, 504], # Retry on these HTTP errors
)


# Research Agent: Its job is to use the google_search tool and present findings.
research_agent = Agent(
    name="ResearchAgent",
    model=Gemini(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
        retry_options=retry_config
    ),
    instruction="""You are a specialized research agent. Your only job is to use the
    google_search tool to find 2-3 pieces of relevant information on the given topic and present the findings with citations.""",
    tools=[google_search],
    output_key="research_findings",  # The result of this agent will be stored in the session state with this key.
)

print("✅ research_agent created.")


# Summarizer Agent: Its job is to summarize the text it receives.
summarizer_agent = Agent(
    name="SummarizerAgent",
    model=Gemini(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
        retry_options=retry_config
    ),
    # The instruction is modified to request a bulleted list for a clear output format.
    instruction="""Read the provided research findings: {research_findings}
Create a concise summary as a bulleted list with 3-5 key points.""",
    output_key="final_summary",
)

print("✅ summarizer_agent created.")


# Root Coordinator: Orchestrates the workflow by calling the sub-agents as tools.
root_agent = Agent(
    name="ResearchCoordinator",
    model=Gemini(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
        retry_options=retry_config
    ),
    # This instruction tells the root agent HOW to use its tools (which are the other agents).
    instruction="""You are a research coordinator. Your goal is to answer the user's query by orchestrating a workflow.
1. First, you MUST call the `ResearchAgent` tool to find relevant information on the topic provided by the user.
2. Next, after receiving the research findings, you MUST call the `SummarizerAgent` tool to create a concise summary.
3. Finally, present the final summary clearly to the user as your response.""",
    # We wrap the sub-agents in `AgentTool` to make them callable tools for the root agent.
    tools=[AgentTool(research_agent), AgentTool(summarizer_agent)],
)

print("✅ root_agent created.")


runner = InMemoryRunner(agent=root_agent)
response = await runner.run_debug(
    "What are the latest advancements in quantum computing and what do they mean for AI?"
)
```


### Sequential Workflows - The Assembly Line

The agent outputs became the input for the next agent.[^1]

Here's a writing Agent demo.

```python
# Outline Agent: Creates the initial blog post outline.
outline_agent = Agent(
    name="OutlineAgent",
    model=Gemini(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
        retry_options=retry_config
    ),
    instruction="""Create a blog outline for the given topic with:
    1. A catchy headline
    2. An introduction hook
    3. 3-5 main sections with 2-3 bullet points for each
    4. A concluding thought""",
    output_key="blog_outline",  # The result of this agent will be stored in the session state with this key.
)

print("✅ outline_agent created.")


# Writer Agent: Writes the full blog post based on the outline from the previous agent.
writer_agent = Agent(
    name="WriterAgent",
    model=Gemini(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
        retry_options=retry_config
    ),
    # The `{blog_outline}` placeholder automatically injects the state value from the previous agent's output.
    instruction="""Following this outline strictly: {blog_outline}
    Write a brief, 200 to 300-word blog post with an engaging and informative tone.""",
    output_key="blog_draft",  # The result of this agent will be stored with this key.
)

print("✅ writer_agent created.")


# Editor Agent: Edits and polishes the draft from the writer agent.
editor_agent = Agent(
    name="EditorAgent",
    model=Gemini(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
        retry_options=retry_config
    ),
    # This agent receives the `{blog_draft}` from the writer agent's output.
    instruction="""Edit this draft: {blog_draft}
    Your task is to polish the text by fixing any grammatical errors, improving the flow and sentence structure, and enhancing overall clarity.""",
    output_key="final_blog",  # This is the final output of the entire pipeline.
)

print("✅ editor_agent created.")


root_agent = SequentialAgent(
    name="BlogPipeline",
    sub_agents=[outline_agent, writer_agent, editor_agent],
)

print("✅ Sequential Agent created.")


runner = InMemoryRunner(agent=root_agent)
response = await runner.run_debug(
    "Write a blog post about the benefits of multi-agent systems for software developers"
)
```

### Parallel Workflows - Independent Researchers


> [!quote]
> When you have independent tasks, you can run them all at the same time using a `ParallelAgent`. This agent executes all of its sub-agents concurrently, dramatically speeding up the workflow. Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.
