## Just write

Refactoring the project, removing temporary components and unused modules to simplify the architecture and reduce maintenance risk. （60%）

This spirit:
* Integrated Keycloak for IAM. ✅ （OIDC with Harbor blocked for the current user/password grant model is unmodified. Will fix it when migrating to Tencent Cloud.）
* Bug fix for service upgrade. ✅
* Enhance the CLI.
* Completed integration testing.
