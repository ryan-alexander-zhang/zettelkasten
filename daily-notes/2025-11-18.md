## Just write

* x402 Paywall
	* Decide whether to continue working on it and state the reasons.
	* Brainstorm architecture.
		* Cloudflare worker. Add `X-Paywall-Auth` header.
		* Cloudflare KV to store configuration.
* Hive
	* Stop developing the async workflow. Too much effort for too little gain.
		* Idempotent operation. (Depends on Kubernetes.)
		* Fail fast.
	* Golang orchestration layer question.
		* **The orchestration layer is too thin. It only wraps the Go Kubernetes SDK and exposes simple HTTP endpoints for Knative, Tekton, and others. Maintaining this layer is unnecessary. I would like to remove the Golang orchestration layer. Replace it with Fabric8, which can generate the SDK from CRD YAML.**
		* Service Account. Cluster role: `knative-serving-namespaced-admin`
			* Application SA. (r+w)
				* Kubernetes resources.
				* Knative resources.
				* Tekton resources.
			* Build SA
				* Knative resources.
				* Tekton resources.
			* Pod SA
* x402 open source
	* Code review.
