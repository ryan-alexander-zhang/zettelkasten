MCP serves as an integration layer within the Agent system, acting as a portal for the Agent to interact with external resources. The reasoning service will select specific MCP tools and map them to [[20260111141606-function-calling|function-calling]]. This enables the LLM to decide whether to invoke a particular function or not.
